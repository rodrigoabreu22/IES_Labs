If I add multiple consumers they will also receive the messages of the subscribed topic (in this case lab05).
Consumers will not receive messages sent before they start, they only start receiving messages in the moment they join.

If I stop a consumer and run it again it will receive the messages of the subscribed topic sent when it was desactivated when a new message is sent.
